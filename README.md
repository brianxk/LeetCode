# LeetCode
Repository that is automatically synced with my LeetCode solutions. 

The sync workflow is forked from https://github.com/joshcai/leetcode-sync with some modifications to edit destination path. 

The goal is to create a folder for each problem that automatically pulls in the problem description from LeetCode as its own README file.
